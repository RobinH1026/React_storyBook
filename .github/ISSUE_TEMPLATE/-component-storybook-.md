## Salary penalty
- Submission over deadline
    - Salary deduction 25%/day
        - Deadline for the first delivery
        - Usually doesn't happen, time can be discussed and the key is to communicate
            - Before : You can propose the completion time, if there is any problem, we will discuss with you
            - In Progress : You can ask the problems encountered, and discuss the schedule change
        - Prevent
            - Disappear without communication, and then suddenly appear after Deadline to deliver the project
            - Due to various reasons, the development cannot be completed, but the unfinished project is delivered for acceptance
- Quality problem
    - Salary deduction 1% per questions 
    - Test by QC team 
    - Include 
       - Function
              - Fulfilling requirements.
              - Delivering complete code and functionality.
       - Fool-proof design (Acceptance Check List)
              - API
              - UI 
     - Prevent
          - Developers deliver without testing completeness, causing a lot of burden on QC manpower
          - The developer does not fully guarantee the code developed by himself, so the quality is reversely required in this way
          - For example: 
                  - Currently our deployment process is: issue -> dev -> main -> prerelease -> release
                  - It may have been 1~2 weeks since this process has been completed. During these stages, different users may detect different levels of problems, but we have encountered some developers who limit their code to only issue or 24HR.
                  - But if you develop in a way that will preserve your code, fix bugs instead of payroll deductions
- Incapable of completing
       - Accepting the case but incapable of completing it.
       - Only paid for completed jobs, and 
                  - Maximum salary is 75% of the total project budget.
